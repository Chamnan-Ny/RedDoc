# RedDoc

## A Penetration Testing Report Management Application

RedDoc is a Flutter-based penetration testing report management application designed to help penetration testers organize, document, and manage vulnerability findings during security assessments. The application provides a centralized platform for creating penetration testing projects, recording vulnerabilities, attaching evidence screenshots, and managing reports in the cloud.

RedDoc uses Firebase Authentication for secure user registration and login, Cloud Firestore for cloud-based data storage, and Firebase Storage for storing vulnerability evidence. The application follows a layered architecture using models, repositories, services, and UI components to demonstrate clean software engineering practices.

This project is developed as an educational cybersecurity mobile application for the **Mobile Development in Cybersecurity** course. It demonstrates Flutter development, Firebase integration, CRUD operations, image upload, repository architecture, and cloud-based penetration testing report management.

**Note:** The current version focuses on the **Report Designer** module. The **Manager review workflow** will be implemented in a future version.

# Project Direction

**Cybersecurity Application – Penetration Testing Report Management**

RedDoc assists penetration testers in documenting and organizing vulnerability findings throughout the penetration testing process. Instead of creating traditional PDF reports, the application provides a centralized cloud workspace where users can create projects, manage findings, upload evidence, and organize penetration testing reports efficiently.
